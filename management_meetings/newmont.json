            "description": "A significant discrepancy was detected between the fuel volume recorded by the inlet meter and what is reflected in the tank levels. Although deliveries are validated as complete, the tank measurement system consistently reports much lower volumes, such as a delivery of 34,000 liters showing only 27,000. It is concluded that the tank level measurement system is faulty, and its repair or replacement is requested. Operations were requested to provide the frequency of the respective system checks, to identify the calibration periods of the measurement hardware, and to find the root cause of the anomaly in the tank levels.",
