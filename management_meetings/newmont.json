            "description": "An operational error during truck unloading—caused by a valve not being opened—led to the pump running dry. This resulted in multiple incorrect delivery records and a fuel shortage of approximately 2,000 liters. Technical support (Veridapt) was contacted, canceled the erroneous transactions, and adjusted the volumes to correct the data.",

            "description": "A significant discrepancy was found between the inlet meter readings and the tank level measurements. Despite deliveries being validated as complete, the tank level system consistently reports lower volumes—for example, a 34,000-liter delivery showing only 27,000 liters. It was concluded that the tank level measurement system is faulty, and repair or replacement has been requested.",
